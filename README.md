# dataviz_template

A template to quick start dataviz projects

The visualisation must start with a logo, and the title aligned to the left.

A typical dataviz is one page only, 750px width.
And kept as simple as possible.

The color scheme is given and must be kept simple. (black text blue/red colors)

Keep in mind that it could be played on mobile AND desktops.
Avoid platform dependent events as ScrollWheel, RightClicks, Swipes, and so on.

All required files (scripts, css, etc) must be contained in the project.
No external dependencies


Each project must contain a thumbnail.png file, that reflect the appearance of the dataviz, to display in the dataviz gallery.
